# sibyl
Sibyl is a lightweight orchestration layer for LLM and MCP-based workflows. It lets you define workspaces and pipelines in config, reuse techniques for things like RAG and data integration, and expose those workflows through plugins (OpenAI tools, editor integrations, routers, or custom frontends), with example scenarios.
