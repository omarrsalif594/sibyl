# Configuration notes:
# - Ruff is configured to only check critical rules (F, E9, I) in pyproject.toml
# - --exit-zero ensures pre-commit doesn't block commits (warnings only)
# - Developers can bypass with: git commit --no-verify (use sparingly)
# - Run manually: pre-commit run --all-files
# - Update hooks: pre-commit autoupdate
